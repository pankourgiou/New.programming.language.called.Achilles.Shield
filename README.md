if you copy paste and run from the cmd the file like python Achilles_shield.py it should open a repl...there you can write help and see the available commands..this is only the beginning of it yet it relates with .Achilles_shield files for example it should run on cmd python Achilles_shield.py hello.Achilles_shield enjoy! after posting the file i added a loop command..:)
